# arduino-code-checker

## Introduction

The ```arduino-code-checker``` project aims to create a library that can be used to check the correctness of Arduino source code and its related circuit, as created in the [TinkerCAD](https://www.tinkercad.com/) simulation environment.

It is planned to be a support tool to instructors and students involved in basic Arduino programming and board building, by identifying patterns as:

- Code that reads from or writes to ports that are not connected to electronic
